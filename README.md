# Gonut

Under development, 

Most features are already available except output format.

```shell
go install -v github.com/wabzsy/gonut/gonut@latest

gonut -h

# OR

git clone https://github.com/wabzsy/gonut

cd gonut/gonut

go build -v

./gonut -h
```

Usage is roughly the same as https://github.com/TheWover/donut
